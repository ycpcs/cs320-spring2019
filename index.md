* **Apr 23** - [Team Project Milestone 4](assign/assign03.html) is due Wednesay, May 2nd.  This will be a FORMAL 8-10 minute (max) in-class team presentation/demonstration of your team's progress since milestone 3.  You should have a 95% working system, with a higher degree of "polish".  All SQL database functionality should be implemented for this milestone.  See the guidelines for [Team Project Milestone 4](assign/assign03.html).

* **Apr 9** - [Individual Project Milestone 3](assign/assign04.html) is due Monday, April 23rd.  This will be your final Informal (at your desk) 2-4 minute (max) in-class demonstration of your individual project.

* **Apr 9** - [Team Project Milestone 3](assign/assign03.html) **has been moved** to due Friday, April 20th.  This will be a FORMAL 8-10 minute (max) in-class team presentation/demonstration of your team's progress since milestone 2.  SQL database functionality **IS REQUIRED** for this milestone.  A large majority of your classes, methods, test cases, and web page navigation should be implemented by milestone 3, as well.

* **Apr 6** - Mid-semester self/peer evaluations are due Sunday, April 8th.  See the instructions under [Assignment 11](assign/assign11.html).

* **Mar 26** - Posted an extensive example project on the [Resources page](./resources) that incorporates the Web Applications lab solution (Lab02) with the ORM Lab solution (Lab06).  It provides a web application front-end to the ORM queries, as well as demonstrates the use of login session information, and incorporation of a SQL database persistence layer with a many-to-many relationship.

* **Mar 21** - [Team Project Milestone 2](assign/assign03.html) is due Friday, April 6th.  This will be a FORMAL 8-10 minute (max) in-class team presentation/demonstration of your team's progress since milestone 1.  SQL database functionality is **NOT** required for this milestone (but **IS** required for the third milestone.)

* **Mar 21** - WOO HOO, A SNOW DAY...  But be careful what you wish for, since that pushes [Individual Project Milestone 2](assign/assign04.html) out to Wednesday, April 4th.  This will be an informal (at your desk) 2-4 minute (max) in-class demonstration of your progress since Milestone 1.  Thus, you will have back-to-back milestone presentations the week you return from Spring Break - Individual MS2 on Wednesday, 4-4-18 and Team MS2 on Friday, 4-6-18.

* **Mar 20** - The **midterm exam** will be in-class on **Wednesday, 3-28-18**.  It will be open notes and you can use any resource on the CS320 website, as well as your lab solutions.  A practice exam is posted.  We will use Monday, 3-26-18, to go over an end-to-end solution for the books database we've been working with, as well as a short review for the exam.  The exam will be 120 points, and it will be difficult to finish in the time allotted, if you do not know the material.  It will graded on a 100 point basis, thus it has a built-in 20-point curve.  You can choose which questions to concentrate your effort on, but all questions will be graded.

* **Mar 6** - [Lab04: SQL, Queries, Joins](labs/lab04.html) is posted.  The due date has been **moved** to **Thursday, 3-8-18**.

You should have the vast majority of your servlets and JSPs defined, and be able to navigate between most, if not all, of your pages.  Your HTML/CSS will still be in a rough state - don't worry about making it "pretty", focus on functionality over form.  There is **NO** expectation for having any of your SQL database implemented or working.
