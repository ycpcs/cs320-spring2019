This page links to practice exams.

Note: in Spring 2016, the two exams were take-home, while this semester there is a single exam that will take place in class.  So, you can expect the actual in-class exam to be a combination of similar questions from the two practice exams, with an emphasis on the second exam, and certainly shorter than the the first exam.
